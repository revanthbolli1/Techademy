                    <h2>FULL STACK DEVELOPER</h2>
                    <p>Full-stack technology refers to the entire depth of a computer system application, and full stack web developers are those who are capable of developing both the front end and the back end of web development. All of the features that are visible to the client, or the viewer of the site, are included in the front end. Programming a browser (By using JavaScript, jQuery, Angular, or Vue)Programming a server (By using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)Let’s say you’re using your Instagram application. Every time you refresh, new content is loaded on your screen. You can like a picture, add new ones, search for profiles and do so much more. Although it provides a seamless user experience, there’s a lot that goes on in the backend. HTTP requests are made to the Instagram servers to retrieve and load information. This is facilitated with the help of backend frameworks. Typically every application consists of the front-end, the backend, and the database. A Full Stack Developer is associated with the creation of an application from its start to finish. He designs the front-end and the backend of an application while ensuring its efficiency, reliability, and other crucial features. </p>

                    <h2>ANDROID DEVELOPER</h2>
                    <P>An application is incomplete if it lacks modern UI. An application may contain useful functionalities, but if it fails to adapt to modern UI guidelines, then it is ultimately doomed to fail. Using RecyclerView to implement lists and grids, using ConstraintLayout for designing complex layouts, applying animations to enhance user experience, using appropriate menus, following Material design guidelines and using vector drawables instead of raster graphics are a few of the basic rules that every developer must follow in their apps. While designing layouts one must not forget to consider the multiple screen type devices. The same app should look different for different devices. For example, the screen on a tablet should show dual-pane layouts to effectively utilize a widescreen. While on a smartphone it should use single pane. This behavior can be achieved by using Fragments. Additionally, in several cases, you might need to customize Views that suit your need. This can be achieved by designing custom components for your Views. Users interact with your app on a variety of levels, from pressing a Submit button to downloading information onto their device. Accordingly, you should test a variety of use cases and interactions as you iteratively develop your app. The most commonly used testing libraries are Expresso, Junit, Mockito, Robolectric and UI Automator.</P>

                    <h2>IOS DEVELOPER</h2>
                    <p>Developers have in-depth knowledge of how iOS works on different Apple devices, like the iPad, Apple Watch, and iPhone. iOS developers build, test, and fine-tune applications to suit the needs of their clients. Typically, iOS app development is done in one of two programming languages: Swift or Objective-C. You can learn more about what type of software products iOS developers create in the next few sections. Gaming applications are the most popular category in the Apple app store [1]. A notable example is Apex Legends, Apple's iPhone Game of the Year in 2022 [2]. It was developed by iOS developers at Electronic Arts (EA), a video game publishing company. iOS developers specializing in game development may be employed by companies like EA or Ubisoft, work independently, or partner with other creatives for a specific gaming project. You can explore public code repositories, tools, and tutorials for iOS game development on GitHub. A good productivity app helps you solve a problem or get things done more efficiently. For example, Evernote is a robust note-taking app that stores text, links, images, files, and more. The Grammarly app checks content for grammar mistakes and makes suggestions for improvements to your writing. Creating a to-do-list-style productivity app is an excellent exercise for a novice iOS developer. Although the concept is simple, the execution has plenty of room for expanded features.</p>

                    <h2>DEVOPS ENGINEER</h2>
                    <P>DevOps engineers reduce that complexity, closing the gap between actions needed to quickly change an application, and the tasks that maintain its reliability. Development teams and IT operations teams can have different skills and different goals. Developers want to introduce new features to an application, while operations teams want to preserve the stability of an application once it is released. DevOps is all about the unification and automation of processes, and DevOps engineers are instrumental in combining code, application maintenance, and application management. All of these tasks rely on understanding not only development life cycles, but DevOps culture, and its philosophy, practices, and tools. Within an agile environment, developers, system administrators, and programmers can be siloed, working on the same product but not sharing information necessary to ensure value to the user. Some organizations may hire professionals to "perform DevOps" within their workflows, but because successful DevOps adoption depends on changes to culture and process, this may just deepen the disconnect between developers and operational teams.</P>

                    <h2>.NET DEVELOPER</h2>
                    <p>A net developer is responsible for producing code using .net languages such as C# and VB. Net developers create applications from scratch, configure existing systems and provide user support. Also, net developers are able to write functional code with a sharp eye for spotting defects. A net developer's overall goal is to work with internal teams to design, develop and maintain software. Net developers are employed by companies within differing industries. A bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or any related field along with 3 years of demonstrable experience is required for net developer positions. Successful net developers possess excellent troubleshooting and communication skills and have an eye for details.</p>
