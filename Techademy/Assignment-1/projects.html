                    <h2>HOME AUTOMATION</h2>
                    <p>A home automation system will monitor and/or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. When connected with the Internet, home devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things ("IoT"). A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central smart home hub (sometimes called a "gateway"). The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet. While there are many competing vendors, there are increasing efforts towards open source systems. However, there are issues with the current state of home automation including a lack of standardized security measures and deprecation of older devices without backwards compatibility. Home automation has high potential for sharing data between family members or trusted individuals for personal security and could lead to energy saving measures with a positive environmental impact in the future. The home automation market was worth US$64 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to over $163 billion in 2028.</p>

                    <h2>VEHICLE REGISTRATION CHECK</h2>
                    <p>Here we are going to discuss the existing systems and other drawbacks in the manual earlier system of registration of the vehicles. The system we are using an i.e. manual system of the registration of the vehicles is very tiresome and time-consuming. It takes a lot of time and going there in offices, lining up in queues. The most common problem is knowing the proper information about the documents and procedure and pricing. Here comes the problem of agents in that where they make huge money, of no way of the hard-earned money of poor people. So, above this is the whole process of getting vehicle insurance by our system we can make it a little bit simpler and the fast process of automating it. We can automate this process by creating an application that will allow you to use these things in a fully functional way and the application will include the following entities (an entity is a real-world object). Admin will use this system to verify the user, userâ€™s document and on the basis of that he will check the payments and if found all the criteria fulfilled, he will sanction the unique registration numbers to them or to their vehicle. This panel is the most important everything under this is supervised by the main authority. Only through this panel, the requests can be passed.</p>

                    <h2>SELF-DRIVING CARS</h2>
                    <P>An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. Self-driving cars, also called autonomous vehicles or driverless cars, are cars and trucks that can understand and navigate the environment with little to no help from a human driver. While consumers cannot yet buy a car that fully drives itself (Level 4 or 5 automation), the technology is under development and improving quickly. The self-driving cars being worked on today have many different sensors and cameras to capture information about the world and rely on computer vision, machine learning, and many other programs to interpret and react to that information. The goal is to create cars that are safe, perhaps even safer than human drivers, and efficient.</P>
